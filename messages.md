Ooooohmmmm. Looks like youâ€™re feeling pretty zen when visiting [x]. Could be a good application for decompression.


## Tense, agitated, afraid

Woah there tiger! Let's take a breather and try to cut back on using [x]. It's getting you pretty worked up.

### High time on [x]

Whew. Take a few deep breaths because you've spent a lot of time using [x].

### Low time on [x]

Good job staying away from [x].


## Focus

Woohoo you're in the zone on [x].

### Low time on [x]

Hey seems like you get pretty engaged when using [x] but you don't use it often. Have you thought about using more often?


## Very relaxed

Hmmm. Did you fall asleep while doing [x]?
